Prompt:

<p>

Since we just finished a week of assignments that were entirely group-based, reflect on the differences between collaborative and solitary coding.

<p>



>How do you approach the planning, design, and writing phases differently when you're working alone vs. in a group?

My planning process when solo is nonexistent; I straightaway start on the problem, doing the things I can, and figuring out the issues as I go along. My design process is similar. Having a partner definitely required a different approach. It was good to have a different mouth and set of eyes and ears to contribute toward our project.

>How is source control affected (GitHub)?

Wasn't really an issue. Keron and I made sure to communicate about the project and were strict in keeping our changes from conflicting.

>Which do you prefer? Why?

I still greatly prefer working solo. I'm introverted and have never liked group projects. I tend to go pretty quickly through material, jumping around the project, knocking out the stuff I know, and finding about a thousand ways to fail on the stuff I don't. I find it really difficult to apply that same style of work into a group setting. I don't think I'd mind a group project wherein I was given a discrete area of work that was to be applied to the final project. But that wasn't really how group week went.

 >Are there aspects of either/both that you could work on to improve your performance when in either situation?

In the case of group situations? Without a doubt. I know my solitary style of work will be a disadvantage when entering this field, so I should get used to working on things as a group.
