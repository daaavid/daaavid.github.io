So what goes into here? I guess you didn't get to it. 

I guess I should be writing the sort of stuff that goes into a journal.

So the SHIELD tracker app is done. I can't say I confidently understand some of the code that I implemented. The most apparent issue was the Apple documentation again; I don't know if I just don't have enough experience, or I'm just not looking at it in the right way, but the way it's presented seems so cryptic and bare-bones. There are so few code snippets of actual examples; I always end up just picking at the meager offerings of necessarily recent google results. Otherwise, it could be in the wrong syntax. Then I'll just be wasting more time.
