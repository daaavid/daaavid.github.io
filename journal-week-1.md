* What do developers do? What principles of a developer have you learned?

Developers are creators. Developers are engineers, writers, and their own test pilots. Chief principles of the developer that I have learned are to be determined, creative, open-minded, and unafraid of failure. 


* Explain how the user experience of your app should impact how you design and construct your code. How should user-focused considerations affect your code structure?

As a developer, one must always place ease of use as a top priority. The interface must be intuitive, uncluttered, and useful. Unnecessary frills or overly wordy sections can be shaved in consideration of a streamlined aesthetic. Code-wise, one should endeavor to be concise and efficient; unnecessary computations can slow down the traverse throughout the interface and breed user frustration. However, one must be careful not to minimalize excessively. A developer should strive to forge apps that are beatiful, but still powerful.

* Explain the branching principle in Git. Why do we branch? What does branching enable for our codebase?

The practice of branching allows for colleague collaboration or otherwise, solo organization of development going forward. A practical example: a master branch of an app at version 1.0, with features of version 2.0 branching off of it. Consequently, one can pick and choose which new features to implement concisely.
