Any of those unpleasant emotions of fear that at times loom over our soul, that want a controlling change over our God blessed well-being?  Man's fears:  Oh, they're so real, yes they're uninvited intruders, and they may happen to attach themselves to us all, even affecting God's choice servants. "After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward" (Genesis 15:1).  After Abram had been blessed with the Lord's victorious conquest over the enemy (14:20), God came to him with the assurance that fear is also conquered: "Fear not Abram!"  The why: a shield!  The Who: The Lord was his shield.  Nothing negative in the world of fearfulness could bypass the Lord, OUR SHIELD!  Our hearts are under His sovereign protection, shielded, then giving to us His "exceeding great reward," His peace!  Our spiritual assignment: Exchange our fears for His fear!  "Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield" (Psalm 115:11).
