Need some newness as we are all positioned at the cusp of an old year, now focusing our sights on the new?  Rejoice, the Lord has a more than ample supply of His newness headed in your direction, all made possible through throne-room proclamation.  "And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful" (Revelation 21:5).  "He said" it, we believe it, and what a great verse to APPLY for our newsness-needed life, in "all things!"  Our assignment: no, we can't make our old life new;  better yet:  He can!  We can set our new year sights higher, and "behold" the newness, because He "makes" it so!"  As a new creation in Christ, old things pass away, and all things are becoming new (2 Corinthians 5:17).   Believe it: newness!   Behold it: newness! Become of it: newness!  A moment by moment new life comes from Him, all with His pronounced newness.  Just abide in Him (John 15:1-5) this coming year, because He's the One who "makes all things new!"  "And he said unto me: "Write!"  May a new chapter be written with His "Signature Script of Newness" on the table of your heart.  Yes, He wants to do the writing; and yes, He can, because He is faithful & true.
