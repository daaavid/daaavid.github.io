Looking for that perfect place to live, that "DREAM HOME that exceeds even our own expectancies?" Search no more! That place is not made of brick & mortar, nor is it constructed of siding & shingles. The place to live and the person to live with makes all the difference when it comes to DREAM HOME HAPPINESS, and it's all BIBLE-BUILT: "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8). That perfect place is predicated on His perfect plan: "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering ... willingly with his heart" (v. 2). So: the HEART HOME IT IS, dwelling in Him with His Holy Spirit "oil for light" & "sweet incense"  (V. 6), In a communing love relationship; HE makes the house a home. It all depends on where you want to live and the PERSON dwelling with you!  "Let them make me a sanctuary"!"
