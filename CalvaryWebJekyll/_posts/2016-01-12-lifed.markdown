Need a song in your heart, to lift that "at times" heavy heart of your's, as you enter a new day, for the new year?  Rejoice, there is a REAL SONG FOR A REAL LIFE: YOUR'S, because of the new life God has given those "born-again (John 3:3)!  Here's a Psalm that God's people of old sang to experience His newness!  "For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD" (Psalm 117:2).  What a song of a Psalm: we can sing it for His mercy covers "the old" because of Calvary's cross - the CAUSE for His song to be sung!  His loving kindness paves the way for the new & "is great toward us," - the Spirit's UNCTION prompting us to sing His song.  Then to solidify it all in our soul, we can sing His song with the Bible REALITY of "the truth of the Lord endureth forever!"   With that truth set in our hearts, we joyfully endure - forever!  Yes, it is all true; it's all BIBLE!  Then, there remains only one wonderful, joyful response to it all, and yes it is a song as well.  The Psalmist could not contain it all, nor could he keep the newness song to himself; he sang it, and so can we:  "Praise the Lord!"
