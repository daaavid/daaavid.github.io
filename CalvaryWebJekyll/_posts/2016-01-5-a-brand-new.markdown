Need some spiritual newness in your new year that can stir your soul "out of oldness activity" into the new?  If you mind goes there, let your heart follow.  There exists the greatest Biblical soul venture that anyone can possess & practice: LOVE & LOVING (1 Corinthians 13:13)!  Btw, that spiritual exercise might be "old" to some, but to Jesus, He calls it NEW.  "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (John 13:34).  A new commandment generated by love, captivating your soul to newness, His love.  Which in turn will generate love from a soul transformed by that love, that can make the difference in another's soul.  His love does that, exactly that, and makes the one loving and the one being loved feel NEW.  Could it be that is why HIS LOVE & LOVING with His brand of love is & always has been, and always will be NEW in His book!  It can be in your's as well!  Make that LOVE NEW!  Obey love's command, and experience a BRAND NEW NEWNESS!
