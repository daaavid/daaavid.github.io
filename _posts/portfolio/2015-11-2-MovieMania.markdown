description: <p>A foray into Objective C, Movie Mania is an app that features the ability to search for any movie in the extensive OMDb database and look up information on this movie such as plot summary, featured actors, review scores, review consensus, and more. Previous searches are saved in a selectable history popover menu. The detail scroll view has a parallax effect on which I spent some time making perfect. :)</br></br> This application was a collaboration with Keron Williams, another other TIY student.</br></br></br>Powered by <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com" target="_blank">The OMDb</a> API. </p>
