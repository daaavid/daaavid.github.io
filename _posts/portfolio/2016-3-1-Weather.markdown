description: Another weather app. Don't get too excited, now! <br> I wanted to remake my previous weather app, Forecaster, in Objective C and ended up putting a whole new spin on it. More user-friendly, cleverly-coded, and concise than its predecessor. <br><br>Main screen is a jumbo forecast display with the current weather prominently featured, and the daily/hourly forecast in the tableview below. You can switch from daily and hourly forecasts by toggling the control at the top of the tableview. You can select any of the forecast cells to view a bit more about the weather at that time. You can use the star button to save a location, and the menu button allows you to view your saved locations (as well as their current weather) or search for a new location. Select the saved location/search result to pop back to the main view and display the forecast for that location. Background/color scheme change based on the time of day (hadn't hit my gimmick counter yet).
