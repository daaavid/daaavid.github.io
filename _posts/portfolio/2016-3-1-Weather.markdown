description: Another weather app. Don't get too excited, now! <br> I wanted to remake my previous weather app, Forecaster, in Objective C and ended up putting a whole new spin on it. More user-friendly, cleverly-coded, and concise than its predecessor. Background/color scheme change based on the time of day (hadn't hit my gimmick counter yet).
