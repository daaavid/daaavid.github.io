description: <p> One of my earliest apps; Todo is exactly what is says on the tin&#58; a todo app (everyone has to have made one, right?). Users can add and edit entries and set due-by dates for them. They also have the option to set notifications to remind them of these entries. </br></br> I used CoreData for data persistence and added Local Notifications a bit later to spice it up a little.</p>
