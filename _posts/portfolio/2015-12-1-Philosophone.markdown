description: <p> The first thing many people look at when they first wake up is their mobile phone. Philosophone is an app that helps those people to start their day in the right state of mind by starting it with a quote -- whether it be funny, inspirational, artful, other, or all of the above. Philosophone allows you set a notification to get a quote from a single or several categories every day, at a user-defined time, delivered straight to your phone for you to enjoy. </br></br> Quotes are beautifully and dynamically typed out with various genuine old-school typewriter sound effects. All buttons throughout the app also give off a satisfying typewriter clack and animation when tapped, lending to a more engaging and fun user experience. </br></br>Powered by <a href="https://theysaidso.com/api/" target="_blank">They Said So's quote API.</a> </p>
