description: <p>My earliest "big" app, Forecaster allows you to get current weather, detailed weather information, and a weekly forecast for a given location. Users are given the ability to search by zip code, city, or utilize location services in order to determine the weather at their current location and make a list of these locations. These locations are saved via NSCoding and new weather information is loaded in upon re-launching the application.</br></br>This is when I first started experimenting on my own with animation -- It quickly became one of my core assets.</p>
