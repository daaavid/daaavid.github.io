description: <a target = "_blank" href="http://app.howmuchtrip.com">Application Landing Page.</a> <br> HowMuchTrip is a budget-central trip planning application which helps the user plan the best possible trip for their allotted budget. We utilized Parse heavily for remote and local storage as well as social media integration with services such as Facebook and Twitter. Various API's were used to supplement features such as location autocomplete, location coordinates, and real-time flight cost searching. Heavy focus on UI/UX, featuring beautiful animations, transitions, and design, and user affordances in order to reduce user frustration and keep it a happy experience. We performed a limited-release beta to over twenty users in order to refine our UI/UX implementation. Planned features include flight and hotel booking. HowMuchTrip was my final project for the iOS Development course at The Iron Yard. This application was a collaboration among myself and Jen Hamilton and Chris Stomp, two other TIY students.
