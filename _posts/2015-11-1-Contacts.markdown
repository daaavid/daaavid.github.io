description: <p>Exactly what it says on the tin! Contacts is a contacts app that allows you to add and save contacts via Realm local storage with details such as name, phone number, and email address. The phone and email buttons allow you to call or email the selected contact respectively. You can set a contact as a favorite and view them in the Favorites menu. Contact details are verified for correct format via REGEX and the phone number formats as you type.</br></br>Varied animations such as buttons that spin upon touch, views that slide out of view, and an interface based on Google's Material Design keep the app beautiful. </p>
