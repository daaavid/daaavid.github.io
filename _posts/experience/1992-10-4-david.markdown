Hey there! I'm a Mobile Dev who is currently working at <a href="https://www.fattmerchant.com/" target="_blank">Fattmerchant</a> in Orlando, FL. Fattmerchant provides merchant services that combines ultra-competitive, subscription-based pricing and unparalleled, on-demand service and technology.

I attended The Iron Yard Orlando's iOS Engineering course wherein I learned the fundamentals of iOS development. I'm really comfy with Swift and Objective C (although I prefer Swift) and have a decent grasp of HTML, CSS, and Photoshop. (Enough to have built this website.)

Thanks for visiting.
