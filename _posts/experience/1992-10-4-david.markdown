I'm a mid-level developer and recent graduate from The Iron Yard's Mobile Engineering course: a rigorous 10-12 hours a day, 12-week course wherein I learned the essentials of iOS Development. I quickly discovered a passion for programming and development. Despite having little prior programming experience, this newfound passion allowed me to grasp the material and concepts and I quickly took it upon myself to research new material in my free time. As a result, I had the amazing opportunity to become somewhat of an advisor to my fellow students.

I'm always ready and eager to take on new challenges and excited to earn a position where I can channel this enthusiasm and apply my passion for development.

I'm really comfy with Swift and Objective C (iOS) and have a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and Photoshop. (Enough to have built this website.) I'm currently seeking a Mid/Junior level Developer position in or near Orlando, FL, but am open to relocation.
