As the sole developer on this project, I took on the full responsibility of developing the website for Calvary Baptist Church in St Peter, MN. I used Atom and Github for coding and version control, respectively. I used Photoshop for the various website image assets. I update the site regularly with messages from the pastor. Check out the site <a href="http://saintpetercalvarybaptistchurch.org" target="_blank">here</a>.
