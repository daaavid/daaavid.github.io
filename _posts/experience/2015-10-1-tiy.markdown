I learned the essentials of iOS Development in an immersive 12-week course at The Iron Yard in Orlando. Hands-on, rigorous, and intense, the course had us working deeply with Xcode and Github and learning and coding with Swift and Objective C 10-12 hours a day. By the end of the first week, the homework for each night was a light (but full-featured) app.
