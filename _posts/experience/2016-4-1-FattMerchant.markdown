I'm currently the sole Mobile Developer at Fattmerchant; a B2B company that focuses on leveling the playing field between large and small businesses by striving to provide big company rates to small companies, as well as providing easy to use merchant account management technology.

I spend most of my time working on the FattPay mobile application -- a virtual terminal mobile app that lets the user do things like:

• view transactional activity
• send receipts
• create and send invoices
• create, edit, or delete customers
• process card-present transactions with a mobile card reader
• process card-not-present transactions with manual entry or card scanning via the hardware camera

So far, I've managed the entire UI, UX, and codebase. The application is on the app store <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fattpay/id1089292339?mt=8" target="_blank">here</a>.
