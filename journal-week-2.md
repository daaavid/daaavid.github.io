First of all, I really don't like journals. Am I just supposed to write my opinion on recent experiences? What if I don't have an opinion? Do I just make it a useless activity log? If I don't have an opinion or thoughts on anything, I don't care to just make stuff up to fill space.

Actual journal coming up later.
